		2023 has been a harder year to predict than most. <br/><br/>There are major tech trends (the rapid rise of AI) and economic trends (a recessing economy) at play that will likely be quite disruptive to most predictions. <br/>
		<br/>
		My goal with my public letter each year is to give readers a useful model of the year to come. As such, I've stuck to high conviction predictions in the letter below.
